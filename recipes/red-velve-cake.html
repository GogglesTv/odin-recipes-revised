      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tbsp distilled vinegar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Icing:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>5 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup butter, room temperature</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch
        round pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the cake: Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and shortening together in a large
        bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a
        time, beating well after each addition. Combine red food coloring and
        cocoa to make a paste; add to creamed mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix buttermilk, salt, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a small bowl.
        Add flour, alternating with buttermilk mixture, mixing just until
        incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix vinegar and baking soda together; gently fold into cake batter and
        pour into prepared pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
        Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a
        serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the icing: Heat milk and flour in a saucepan over low heat,
        stirring constantly, until thick. Set aside to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, beat sugar, butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl with
        an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and
        beat until frosting is a good spreading consistency. Frost cake layers
        when completely cool.
